- 👋 Hi, I’m @USAJo
- 👀 I’m interested in sharpening my coding skills, specifically python, as well as learning more as time goes on. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to re-enforce my python skills as well as other platforms as they reveal themselves
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my code and potentially that of others
- 📫 you can always shoot me an email, those that are close to me can call. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: Americans eat 100 acres of pizza each day!
